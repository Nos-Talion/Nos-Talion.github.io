I am currently a Research Assistant in the Robot Learning and Control Laboratory at the [Eastern Institute of Technology](https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?lang=en/), where I focus on developing intelligent systems for robotic manipulation. My research interests span across robot manipulation, robot design, control theory, and reinforcement learning, with a growing emphasis on geometric deep learning and generative AI.

Feel free to reach out for collaboration and discussion of research ideas.
